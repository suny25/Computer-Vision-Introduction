# Computer-Vision-Introduction
## Programs consist of computer vision topics.
### 1. QR Code Detector and Decoder
OpenCV Functions to Use 

a. Reading and writing image: cv2.imread(), cv2.imwrite()
<br>
b. Write text on image: cv2.putText()
<br>
c. Draw a line on image: cv2.line()
<br>
d. QR Detection: cv2.QRCodeDetector(), detectAndDecode()
<br><br>

### 2. Using the Mouse for Annotation
In this program, I have create a GUI application which will let the user create a bounding box around a face present in the input image and save the cropped face automatically.

### 3. Resize Image using Trackbar
In this program, I've to create a GUI application which will be an extension of the trackbar. In this program, only scaling up was implemented. My GUI application should be able to allow user to scale up as well as scale down an image.

### 4. Implementation of Morphological Operations
In this program, I've implement both the dilation and erosion from scratch and display the final (correct) image of both the operations. Create two video of intermediate steps of dilation and erosion using VideoWriter.
